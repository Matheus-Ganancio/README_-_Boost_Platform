# README_-_Boost_Platform
Easy-to-use launch platform blueprint with adjustable power and direction, inspired by Sonicâ€™s boost platforms, for Unreal Engine.

Made without AI

This is an animated platform designed to launch your character in the direction and distance you choose. Everything is set up so you can easily customize it without touching any code, simply tweak the parameters directly in the editor or through the Material Instances, as demonstrated in the video:

 If, even with all the customization options, you still want to go further, the Blueprint code is fully commented, making it easy to understand even if you have no prior Blueprint experience.
